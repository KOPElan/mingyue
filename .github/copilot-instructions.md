# C# Development

## C# Instructions
- Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 14 features.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.

## General Instructions
- Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.

## Naming Conventions

- Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService).

## Formatting

- Apply code-formatting style defined in `.editorconfig`.
- Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.
- Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).
- Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.
- Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.
- Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.
- Ensure that XML doc comments are created for any public APIs. When applicable, include `<example>` and `<code>` documentation in the comments.

## Project Setup and Structure

- Show how to implement role-based and policy-based authorization.
- Demonstrate integration with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
- Explain how to secure both controller-based and Minimal APIs consistently.

## Validation and Error Handling

- Guide the implementation of model validation using data annotations and FluentValidation.
- Explain the validation pipeline and how to customize validation responses.
- Demonstrate a global exception handling strategy using middleware.
- Show how to create consistent error responses across the API.
- Explain problem details (RFC 7807) implementation for standardized error responses.

## API Versioning and Documentation

- Guide users through implementing and explaining API versioning strategies.
- Demonstrate Swagger/OpenAPI implementation with proper documentation.
- Show how to document endpoints, parameters, responses, and authentication.
- Explain versioning in both controller-based and Minimal APIs.
- Guide users on creating meaningful API documentation that helps consumers.

## Logging and Monitoring

- Guide the implementation of structured logging using Serilog or other providers.
- Explain the logging levels and when to use each.
- Demonstrate integration with Application Insights for telemetry collection.
- Show how to implement custom telemetry and correlation IDs for request tracking.
- Explain how to monitor API performance, errors, and usage patterns.

## Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Guide users through creating unit tests.
- Do not emit "Act", "Arrange" or "Assert" comments.
- Copy existing style in nearby files for test method names and capitalization.
- Explain integration testing approaches for API endpoints.
- Demonstrate how to mock dependencies for effective testing.
- Show how to test authentication and authorization logic.
- Explain test-driven development principles as applied to API development.

## Performance Optimization

- Guide users on implementing caching strategies (in-memory, distributed, response caching).
- Explain asynchronous programming patterns and why they matter for API performance.
- Demonstrate pagination, filtering, and sorting for large data sets.
- Show how to implement compression and other performance optimizations.
- Explain how to measure and benchmark API performance.

## Deployment and DevOps

- Guide users through containerizing their API using .NET's built-in container support (`dotnet publish --os linux --arch x64 -p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer`).
- Explain the differences between manual Dockerfile creation and .NET's container publishing features.
- Explain CI/CD pipelines for NET applications.
- Demonstrate deployment to Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps, or other hosting options.
- Show how to implement health checks and readiness probes.
- Explain environment-specific configurations for different deployment stages.

## Blazor Code Style and Structure

- Write idiomatic and efficient Blazor and C# code.
- Follow .NET and Blazor conventions.
- Use Razor Components appropriately for component-based UI development.
- Prefer inline functions for smaller components but separate complex logic into code-behind or service classes.
- Async/await should be used where applicable to ensure non-blocking UI operations.

## Naming Conventions

- Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService).

## Blazor and .NET Specific Guidelines

- Utilize Blazor's built-in features for component lifecycle (e.g., OnInitializedAsync, OnParametersSetAsync).
- Use data binding effectively with @bind.
- Leverage Dependency Injection for services in Blazor.
- Structure Blazor components and services following Separation of Concerns.
- Always use the latest version C#, features like record types, pattern matching, and global usings.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Implement proper error handling for Blazor pages and API calls.
- Use logging for error tracking in the backend and consider capturing UI-level errors in Blazor with tools like ErrorBoundary.
- Implement validation using FluentValidation or DataAnnotations in forms.

## Blazor API and Performance Optimization

- Utilize Blazor server-side or WebAssembly optimally based on the project requirements.
- Use asynchronous methods (async/await) for API calls or UI actions that could block the main thread.
- Optimize Razor components by reducing unnecessary renders and using StateHasChanged() efficiently.
- Minimize the component render tree by avoiding re-renders unless necessary, using ShouldRender() where appropriate.
- Use EventCallbacks for handling user interactions efficiently, passing only minimal data when triggering events.

## Caching Strategies

- Implement in-memory caching for frequently used data, especially for Blazor Server apps. Use IMemoryCache for lightweight caching solutions.
- For Blazor WebAssembly, utilize localStorage or sessionStorage to cache application state between user sessions.
- Consider Distributed Cache strategies (like Redis or SQL Server Cache) for larger applications that need shared state across multiple users or clients.
- Cache API calls by storing responses to avoid redundant calls when data is unlikely to change, thus improving the user experience.

## State Management Libraries

- Use Blazor's built-in Cascading Parameters and EventCallbacks for basic state sharing across components.
- Implement advanced state management solutions using libraries like Fluxor or BlazorState when the application grows in complexity.
- For client-side state persistence in Blazor WebAssembly, consider using Blazored.LocalStorage or Blazored.SessionStorage to maintain state between page reloads.
- For server-side Blazor, use Scoped Services and the StateContainer pattern to manage state within user sessions while minimizing re-renders.

## API Design and Integration

- Use HttpClient or other appropriate services to communicate with external APIs or your own backend.
- Implement error handling for API calls using try-catch and provide proper user feedback in the UI.

## Testing and Debugging in Visual Studio

- All unit testing and integration testing should be done in Visual Studio Enterprise.
- Test Blazor components and services using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
- Use Moq or NSubstitute for mocking dependencies during tests.
- Debug Blazor UI issues using browser developer tools and Visual Studio's debugging tools for backend and server-side issues.
- For performance profiling and optimization, rely on Visual Studio's diagnostics tools.

## Security and Authentication

- Implement Authentication and Authorization in the Blazor app where necessary using ASP.NET Identity or JWT tokens for API authentication.

## API Documentation and Swagger

- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation for your backend API services.
- Ensure XML documentation for models and API methods for enhancing Swagger documentation.
